# Contributing to Shelter

Thank you for helping make Shelter better. The project is still an MVP, so small, focused changes with a clear rationale are the easiest to review and operate safely.

## Before you start

- Search existing issues and pull requests for the same topic.
- Open a feature issue before working on large features, new provider integrations, or breaking changes.
- Never report security vulnerabilities publicly. Follow the process in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
- Remove tokens, domains, IP addresses, email addresses, and other sensitive values from logs and screenshots.

Create every contribution from current `dev` and use one of these branch forms:

- `agent/<feature>` for features, refactors, documentation, and maintenance,
- `fix/<name>` for bug and security fixes.

Open that branch against `dev`, never `main`. Dependabot is the only automated
exception to the branch-name rule. Direct pushes to `dev` and `main` are not
part of the contribution flow.

## Local development

You need Node.js 24 or newer and npm 11 or newer.

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
```

The development command starts the web app and API together. Run the complete local check before opening a pull request:

```sh
npm run check
```

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start the API and web panel in development mode |
| `npm run typecheck` | Run strict TypeScript checks in every workspace |
| `npm run test` | Run server, web, and CLI tests |
| `npm run build` | Create production builds |
| `npm run check` | Run typecheck, tests, and build |

Local tests use temporary data and do not modify real Cloudflare, GitHub, or Docker resources. Only run provider or VPS smoke tests with explicit approval and disposable test resources.

GitHub also runs the full check, installer and release-bundle tests, Compose
validation, a production container build, CodeQL, and Dependency Review. All
third-party Actions are pinned to complete commit SHAs; keep the version comment
when Dependabot updates a pin.

## Releases

Only maintainers publish releases. Do not create `v*` tags from a contribution
branch or upload release assets manually. After merged changes pass the
development integration gate on `dev`, a maintainer prepares one explicit
version commit with:

```sh
npm run release:prepare -- 0.3.0
```

The command creates `agent/release-<version>` from exact `origin/dev`; commit
only the root version fields in the two version files there and open its PR to
`dev`. After that PR merges and the development integration gate passes, open
the single release PR from `dev` to `main`. Only after it merges may a
maintainer create the annotated
`v*` tag on the exact `main` commit. The release workflow builds the
multi-platform image once, emits Sigstore-signed provenance, SBOM and asset
attestations, and publishes an immutable GitHub Release. See
[docs/RELEASES.md](docs/RELEASES.md) for the complete process and verification
model.

## What makes a good change

- Keep each pull request focused on one problem or feature.
- Add a regression test for bug fixes and positive and negative tests for new logic.
- Preserve compatibility with existing SQLite databases, volumes, and environment variables.
- Document new configuration in `.env.example` or `.env.server.example` and in the README.
- Reuse the existing UI components and design tokens. Check light mode, dark mode, keyboard navigation, empty states, and small viewports.
- Validate input at API boundaries and treat Cloudflare, GitHub, upload, and deployment code as security-sensitive.

## Pull requests

A pull request should include:

1. a concise description of the problem and the chosen solution,
2. links to related issues,
3. the exact tests that were run,
4. screenshots or a short recording for visible UI changes,
5. migration, rollback, and operational-risk notes when relevant.

By contributing, you confirm that you created the code or may contribute it under terms compatible with the project license. Contributions are published under [GNU AGPL-3.0-only](LICENSE).

The PR policy fails closed when a contribution targets the wrong base, uses an
unsupported branch name, changes the release version outside the focused
same-repository `agent/release-<version>` version-only PR, or when a `main` PR is anything
other than same-repository `dev` with a higher SemVer.
